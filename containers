What is a container?
  A container is a unit of software/deployment which containers everything needed for the code to run:
  - Code
  - Runtime
  - System tools
  - System libraries

Why containers?
  - Faster to deploy smaller units
  - Use fewer resources
  - Faster automation
  - Portability
  - Isolation

Containers are made of layers:
- Base OS (Read only)
- Customizations on OS (Read only)
- Application (Can write)

Container Registry:
- It is a centralized container repository
- e.g. Docker Hub(https://hub.docker.com/), AWS, Azure, GCP
